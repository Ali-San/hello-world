# hello-world
_My first repo, for my 100 days of code challenge_

In 2018 I decided to learn to code, to restart my career. I learned Python and the basics of SQL.<br>
In 2019 I found myself a bit lost, I didn't know how to continue learning on my own. I had the feeling that I couldn't make any more progress on my own, and I didn't know what to do. That's when I heard about the Twitter [100 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). At that time it was impossible for me to join that challenge (my children were 5 and 1 years old, there was _no way_ I could find 1 hour each day to code), but I felt that if I could just commit to code __every day__, even if it was just 10 minutes, I would find a way to improve my skills and learn more. I started my own petit challenge on [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/), an online community of programmers. <br>

In this repo, I'm sharing some of the programs I wrote and shared on SoloLearn during those very rewarding 100 days.

Some programs are just a silly thing, greetings and jokes.<br>
Some programs are my first attempt at solving problems using a recursive approach.<br>
The ones with "OOP" in their name are just __xxxxx__ playful things I wrote as exercises to put into practice what I was learning about classes in Python.__xxxxx__<br>
